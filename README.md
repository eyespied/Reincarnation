## Project Description
Reincarnation is a computationally creative game that focusses on generating a story-driven experience, allowing the user to explore a different timeline for their character every time. The generated content will progress by a yearly basis and will output what the character has done within that year. The game will start from when the character is born till when they die. The main purpose of the story is to experience important life events in the characterâ€™s timeline.
